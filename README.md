## Template sheets for electrodeposition

A template sheet for CHI and Metrohm cells, respectively.
These were printed out and filled in with a pen.

The source files also employ R lists in preparation for a computerised collection
of the deposition parameters.

Use [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) to compile each Rnw file into the resulting PDF (you 
need R and LaTeX).


## Sketches

A TikZ-based sketch of the complete CHI cell during electrodeposition, as well as simple 
sketches of the cell cap with labelled inlets and outlets.
